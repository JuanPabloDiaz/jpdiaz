    "text": "@everettVT \r\n\r\n> Just curious what tool you were planning on using @ognis1205\r\n\r\nThe implementation of client-related components around OpenAPI and gRPC is progressing in Python, Rust, TypeScript, and Java. Since it seems that [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) is being used for Java, Python, and Rust/OpenAPI, I thought of using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) if there is consensus here. Personally, I initially planned to use [openapi-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript) and define some utility types.\r\n\r\n> Something along the lines of this?\r\n> https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/tree/main/packages/openapi-typescript\r\n\r\nTherefore, the implementation method you pointed out will be the baseline, but I intended to make the url-path, request, and response types more type-safe by enabling inference at compile(transpile) time.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to implement the CreateTable API and the auto-generation of the API interfaces, you can take this issue as well. Otherwise, in case of just implementing the CreateTable API alone, please follow the conventional implementation.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nhttps://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/discussions/208#discussioncomment-10223757",

There are mainly two ideas:\r\n\r\n - Automatically generating interfaces from OpenAPI\r\n - Making API URL path union type and replacing fetch with axios\r\n\r\nThe first idea is straightforward but has a wide range of impacts, so I plan to implement it with the intention of including only this part in the PR at first. As for the second idea, I will share code snippets here separately, so please feel free to share your opinions.\r\n\r\nI think this issue is also related to this PR. While some parts of the current OpenAPI specification might lead to a somewhat cumbersome implementation, I believe it is a reasonable implementation considering the future:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/pull/290",
