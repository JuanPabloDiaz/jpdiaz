In my ongoing journey through the world of open source, I've had the opportunity to take on a significant role as a maintainer of two relevant projects for the developer community: [Public APIs](https://publicapis.dev/) and [Dev Resources](https://devresourc.es/). In this article, I want to share how I reached this position, what being a maintainer entails, and how this experience has enriched my professional development.

## The Path to Maintainer Responsibility

My journey toward becoming a maintainer of these projects was a natural evolution driven by curiosity and the desire to learn. It all began by exploring various open source projects, making contributions here and there, and gradually delving deeper into this collaborative ecosystem.

I first discovered the Public APIs repository during my explorations, and through it, I found Dev Resources. What started as occasional contributions transformed into a deeper commitment. I felt identified with the vision of these projects and developed a genuine interest in their growth and maintenance.

After making several Pull Requests and becoming deeply familiar with the structure and purpose of the projects, I took a significant step: I directly contacted the lead developer to offer my help in a more formal way. To my satisfaction, my offer was accepted, and in July 2024, I officially assumed the role of maintainer for both projects.

## What are Public APIs and Dev Resources?

For those unfamiliar with these projects:

**[Public APIs](https://publicapis.dev/)** is a curated collection of public APIs that developers can use in their applications. This resource greatly facilitates the discovery of interfaces to integrate external services into new projects.

**[Dev Resources](https://devresourc.es/)** is a collective compendium of valuable resources for developers, ranging from tools and platforms to tutorials and documentation.

Both projects serve as useful reference points for the development community, providing centralized access to tools and resources that enhance software creation.

## The Responsibilities of a Maintainer

As a maintainer of these projects, my main responsibilities include:

- **Periodic Review of Pull Requests**: Approximately every two weeks, I dedicate time to meticulously review contributions proposed by the community.
- **Evaluation of New Resources**: I analyze whether the suggested resources or APIs align with the project's purpose and if they truly provide value for developers.
- **Quality Control**: I verify that contributions meet the established format and structure standards to maintain repository coherence.
- **Constructive Communication**: When a contribution requires modifications, I must communicate the necessary changes clearly and respectfully to maintain a collaborative and positive community.

- **Updates and Maintenance**: Ensuring that both repositories are kept up-to-date and that the provided information is accurate and relevant.

This role demands attention to detail, consistency, and a commitment to quality that benefits the entire user community.

## Professional Growth Through Project Maintenance

Being a maintainer has represented a significant source of professional development for me in several dimensions:

### Staying Updated with New Technologies

One of the most valuable advantages of reviewing contributions is the constant exposure to new tools, APIs, and resources. Each Pull Request potentially represents a new technology or service that I must evaluate, which naturally expands my knowledge of the technological ecosystem. This "continuous training" allows me to stay aware of the latest trends and innovations in software development.

### Development of Discipline and Consistency

The role of maintainer requires establishing review routines and maintaining a constant commitment to the projects. This responsibility has strengthened my ability to create and maintain productive habits, alternating between different types of tasks and efficiently managing my time.

### Refinement of Technical Skills

The need to carefully review each contribution has honed my technical skills in several aspects:

- **Better understanding of Git and collaborative workflows**
- **Greater ability to review code with a critical eye**
- **Better organization and prioritization of tasks**
- **Improvement in written technical communication**

### Sense of Community and Purpose

Perhaps the most enriching aspect has been feeling part of something bigger. Being a maintainer means contributing to resources that thousands of developers use in their daily work. This sense of purpose and community transforms what could be a solitary activity in front of the computer into an experience connected with developers from around the world.

## The Value of Social Skills in Open Source

If I could give one crucial piece of advice to those who want to get more actively involved in open source, it would be this: don't underestimate the power of social skills. Effective communication, empathy, and the ability to build relationships are just as important as technical skills in this environment.

These "soft skills" are fundamental for:

- **Effectively communicating with contributors** from diverse backgrounds and experience levels
- **Providing constructive feedback** that motivates improvements without discouraging participation
- **Building a positive reputation** within the community
- **Resolving conflicts or disagreements** that inevitably arise in any collaborative project

## The Road Ahead

As I continue in this role, I constantly seek ways to improve my contribution to these projects while exploring opportunities to get involved in larger-scale open source initiatives. Each review, each interaction with the community, and each implemented improvement represents a step in my professional development and in my ability to contribute significantly to the development ecosystem.

## Lessons for Future Contributors

For those considering taking the leap into maintaining open source projects, I can offer these reflections based on my experience:

1. **Start by Contributing**: Before aspiring to maintenance roles, familiarize yourself with the project through regular contributions.

2. **Leave Your Comfort Zone**: These roles will challenge you to constantly expand your knowledge and skills.

3. **Develop Your Network**: Build positive relationships with other contributors and maintainers.

4. **Be Proactive**: If you're interested in a project, don't wait to be invitedâ€”offer your help directly.

5. **Maintain Consistency**: The real value comes from sustained participation over time.

The world of open source is full of opportunities for those willing to step forward and contribute. My experience as a maintainer has been an enriching chapter in my professional journey, and I hope my story inspires others to find their own way to give back to the community.
