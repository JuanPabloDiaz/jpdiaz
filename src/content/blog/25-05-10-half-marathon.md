# My First Half Marathon: Beyond the Pavement

## The Beginning of an Unexpected Journey

Like many of my personal projects, this story begins with family influence. My brother, whom I consider a mentor in many aspects of my life, is a passionate runner. Not just any runner: an athlete who has completed an Ironman in Cartagena and is currently preparing for another one in San Andrés. His dedication to sports has always inspired me, even though running was never my strong suit.

"I have flat feet," I would tell myself, "running is not for me." For years, this narrative limited me. The pain I felt was real, but it turned out to be more surmountable than I imagined. With my brother's guidance, I acquired proper running shoes and specific insoles. Problem solved. What once seemed impossible began to transform into something enjoyable.

And so, almost without realizing it, I went from avoiding running to contemplating the possibility of a half marathon. In January of this year, I took the leap and signed up for the [Charity Chase Half Marathon](https://runsignup.com/Race/Info/NC/Hickory/CharityChaseHalfMarathon) in Hickory, NC, scheduled for May. I didn't know then that this decision would teach me much more than physical endurance.

## Beyond Training

Anyone who has run long distances knows that the real challenge isn't in your legs, but in your mind. During my preparation, I managed to complete the full 21K distance a couple of times. Each kilometer covered was a small personal victory, each session a test of willpower.

What I didn't anticipate was how the actual course would differ from my training routes. On race day, I faced more irregular terrain, with uphill and downhill sections I hadn't experienced before. The body protests, muscles beg for rest, and that's where the real battle begins.

> "The mind is so powerful that it can break through your own physical limitations."

This phrase became my mantra during the race. There were moments when I wanted to stop, when each step seemed impossible. But something strange happens in these situations: you discover reserves of strength you didn't know existed. It's not magic, though it seems like it: it's the power of human determination.

## Breaking My Own Record

The result surprised me as much as the experience: not only did I complete the 21 kilometers on more challenging terrain, but I significantly improved my time. From 2 hours and 30 minutes in training to just 2 hours on race day.

How is it possible to perform better in more difficult conditions? The answer lies in that unique mix of adrenaline, collective atmosphere, and clear purpose that an official race generates. Seeing others running beside you, feeling that shared energy, not wanting to fall behind—all of this creates an emotional fuel that drives your performance beyond what you thought possible.

But more important than the time was my mother's presence, who traveled from Colombia to support me. Having her there, cheering me on, was a reminder of why we do what we do: for the connections, the shared experiences, and the moments that transcend the ordinary.

## Lessons Beyond the Pavement

### Compare Yourself Only to Yesterday's You

One of the most valuable lessons this experience has left me with is the importance of comparing yourself only to yourself. In the age of social media, it's easy to fall into the trap of constantly measuring yourself against others' achievements. We see race times, distances, and athletic accomplishments posted constantly, creating an invisible but powerful pressure.

However, when you run, only two people matter: who you were yesterday and who you are today. You don't know others' journeys: their years of training, their physical context, their natural advantages. But you know your own journey in detail, every obstacle overcome and every small victory.

My 2-hour time might seem modest to an experienced runner, but it represents a personal triumph considering where I came from: someone who completely avoided running due to pain. This approach—measuring my progress against my personal baseline—has given me much deeper satisfaction than any external comparison could offer.

### Mastery of the Mind

Running long distances is an exercise in mental control as much as physical. I discovered that internal dialogue during a race can determine its outcome more than any physical preparation.

It's almost automatic to begin sabotaging yourself when your body hurts and the finish line seems distant. "I can't do this anymore," "this was a mistake," "I should stop"—these thoughts naturally emerge when facing challenges. The fascinating thing is that we have the power to actively transform that dialogue.

I learned to interrupt negative thoughts with constructive affirmations: "I've trained for this," "each step brings me closer to the goal," "pain is temporary, achievement is permanent." This narrative shift isn't simple positive thinking—it's a practical skill that can be cultivated and has tangible effects on physical performance.

This ability to redirect the mind extends far beyond the race track. At work, in personal projects, in moments of doubt—the ability to control and transform our thoughts has become one of my most valuable tools.

### Life is a Balance

Perhaps the deepest lesson this experience has left me with is the understanding that life requires balance. As ambitious professionals, especially in technology, we often fall into patterns of overwork and obsession with productivity. We pursue professional and financial goals as if they were all that matters.

Preparing for and completing a half marathon forced me to adopt a more balanced perspective. I had to make space for training, proper rest, and recovery. I had to pay attention to my nutrition and sleep. In short, I had to take care of myself holistically.

This approach made me question some priorities. I understood that, while professional and financial success is important, it cannot come at the cost of experiences that enrich life. Money comes and goes, material possessions are fleeting, but the experiences and memories we create endure.

That's why I've decided to invest more in myself—not just in education and professional development, but also in experiences that expand my horizons and enrich my life. These races aren't simply athletic events; they're investments in memories and experiences that become part of who I am.

## The Journey Continues

Completing my first half marathon didn't mark the end of a road, but the beginning of a new one. I'm already contemplating new challenges, including eventually a full marathon. But beyond specific athletic goals, what I truly value is the journey itself.

Satisfaction isn't just in crossing the finish line, but in every training session, every early morning, every moment of personal achievement. The medal is a nice symbol, but the true rewards are internal: the strength you discover, the discipline you build, and the perspective you gain.

If you're considering taking the leap into a new challenge—whether a race, a project, or any goal that seems intimidating—my advice is simple: focus on the process, not just the outcome. Enjoy the journey, celebrate small advances, and above all, remember that the only standard that truly matters is your own growth.

As on the track, so in life: the pace is personal, the journey is unique, and the true victory is in continuing to move forward, one step at a time.
