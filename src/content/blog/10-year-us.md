Exactly a decade ago, I landed on American soil with a suitcase full of dreams and a plan that seemed simple: study English for six months, return to Colombia, and work on cruise ships as a chef while traveling the world. Today, looking back, I can't help but smile at the naivety of that initial plan and marvel at the path I actually ended up taking.

## The original dream vs. reality

My education in Colombia was in cooking. I was always passionate about flavors, techniques, and culinary arts. However, destiny had other plans for me. What began as a brief stay to learn English became a journey of self-discovery that took me down paths I never imagined.

As I adapted to living alone in a foreign country, I was also learning more about myself. Maturity came quickly, almost imposed by circumstances, and with it, my aspirations also evolved.

## Disillusionment in the kitchen

Working in American kitchens showed me a reality very different from what I had idealized. The long hours, physical wear, and precarious salaries began to erode my passion for gastronomy. It wasn't just the hard work that discouraged me, but also the environment. As I once said: "the chef is just one among millions of cooks."

However, I don't consider studying cooking to have been wasted time. Thanks to that initial plan of working on cruise ships, I ended up in the United States studying English. As I often think: **things happen for and because of something**. Today I enjoy cooking as a valuable hobby, something I share with my family and friends, but not as my professional path.

## A turn toward technology: rediscovering early passions

Since I was young, I always had curiosity about computers. I would take apart equipment just to see its components, spend hours exploring programs and applications. When I finished high school, I was undecided between studying cooking or computer science.

Life gave me the opportunity to experience both paths. Once established in the United States, I decided to study Computer Science, specializing in web development. Programming awakened in me something similar to what I felt when playing with LEGO as a child: the excitement of building something from scratch, of seeing how my lines of code came to life on the screen.

## The challenges of immigration

These ten years have not been an easy road. Cultural adaptation was a stronger shock than I thought, even having basic English skills. The distance from my family in Colombia was felt more every day, especially when thinking about my brother, my parents, and my nieces.

To combat loneliness, I've kept myself constantly busy. I've worked tirelessly, often with two or three jobs simultaneously. I was a dishwasher, worked in construction, in landscaping, in parking lots... I did what was necessary to support myself and pay for my studies.

## Achievements that build pride

Despite the challenges, these years have also brought me achievements that fill me with pride:

1. **Financial independence**: Saving and buying my first car, a 2007 Suzuki Forenza, was an important milestone. It wasn't luxurious, but it gave me the freedom of movement so necessary in cities like Charlotte.

2. **Self-sufficiency**: Being able to support myself financially without depending on anyone.

3. **Education**: Paying for my studies while working intensely was perhaps my greatest achievement.

After graduating with an Associate's in Web Technology, I was able to enter the formal technology workforce, starting in a call center and working five years in technical support for different companies.

## Reflections on the "American dream"

After a decade in this country, my perspective on the "American dream" has changed substantially. The pandemic and modernization have transformed the rules of the game. Today I believe there are interesting alternatives, such as remote work and digital nomad life, that allow enjoying the best of both worlds.

If I could talk to my past self, I would tell him to think carefully, to analyze carefully, life in the United States can be very lonely, and it's definitely not for everyone. The "American dream" might be in another nation, not necessarily in the United States.

## The final balance

These ten years have transformed me deeply, I have matured, I have discovered strengths I didn't know I had, and I have reoriented my professional path. The sacrifice has been great: leaving my family in Colombia and accepting loneliness as a frequent companion.

However, I have also learned that with effort, perseverance, and good training, it is possible to build the future one desires.

Today I look ahead with different eyes. I dream of finding a remote job that allows me to travel the world and spend time in Colombia with my family, while continuing my professional development. Because if these ten years have taught me anything, it's that plans can change, but the capacity to adapt and the desire to improve must always remain.
