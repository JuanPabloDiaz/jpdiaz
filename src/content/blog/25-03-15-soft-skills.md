In the technology world, we tend to obsess over mastering the latest framework, learning new programming languages, or keeping up with the most recent tools. We dedicate countless hours to perfecting our technical skills, but we often overlook something equally important: soft skills.

## The Imbalance Between Technical and Human Aspects

As a web developer, I've spent much of my career focusing on improving my technical skills. I learned JavaScript, React, Astro, and other technologies I use daily. However, some time ago, I realized something was missing in my professional growth.

I'm naturally shy and reserved. For a long time, I considered this wasn't an issue as long as my code worked correctly. The reality is that this mindset was limiting my potential, both professionally and personally.

## The Epiphany: Knowledge Is Useless If You Can't Communicate It

I reached an important conclusion: it doesn't matter how much technical knowledge you have if you can't communicate it effectively. As developers, we often find ourselves in situations where we need to explain complex concepts to people without technical knowledge.

What's the use of being an expert in web development if you can't understand what your client really needs? Or if you can't explain in simple and clear terms what you're building for them?

In technology, there's a concept called "rubber duck debugging." It involves explaining your code line by line to a rubber duck to find errors. This same principle applies when communicating our ideas: if you can explain a complex technical concept so simply that a child can understand it, you truly master the subject.

## My Personal Struggle with Communication

One of my greatest difficulties occurs at international events where I must communicate in English. I get nervous, ideas don't flow naturally, and I feel like I can't express everything I know. It's frustrating to feel that your knowledge is trapped by communication barriers.

This difficulty has cost me valuable opportunities and connections. I've had to recognize that, regardless of my technical knowledge, my soft skills needed the same dedication and effort.

## The Path to Improvement: Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone

How did I decide to address this challenge? The answer is straightforward: **by constantly stepping out of my comfort zone**. There is no other alternative.

The uncomfortable truth I've learned is that to improve communication and other soft skills, you need to repeatedly expose yourself to uncomfortable situations. There are no magic formulas, miraculous courses, or shortcuts.

My method has been direct and effective:

- **Attending conferences and meetups**: I force myself to attend technical events even when I'd prefer to stay home. Each event is an opportunity to practice.
- **Talking to absolutely everyone**: I challenge myself to initiate conversations with strangers at every event. Yes, it's uncomfortable. Yes, I sometimes say awkward things. And yes, it's exactly what I need to improve.

- **Accepting that "you'll feel embarrassed"**: This has been a major revelation. You have to accept that you'll experience embarrassing moments, that you'll stumble when speaking, that you'll forget words. And that's okay. It's part of the process.

- **Overcoming fear through repetition**: Fear doesn't disappear with theory but with practice. Each time you expose yourself, fear loses a bit of its power over you.

I vividly remember my first presentation in English at an international meetup. I was so nervous that I forgot half of what I had prepared. But you know what? I survived. And the next time was a little less terrible. And so on.

**There's no other way**. If you want to improve these skills, you have to put yourself in situations where you actively practice them, especially when it's difficult for you. Discomfort is the price of growth.

## The Necessary Balance

Technical skills get you interviews, but soft skills get you and keep you jobs. Success in technology isn't just about writing efficient code, but about working effectively with others.

Some crucial soft skills in our industry include:

- **Effective communication**: Explaining complex ideas in a simple way.
- **Teamwork**: Collaborating with people from different areas and experience levels.
- **Empathy**: Understanding the real needs of users and clients.
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting to constant changes in projects and technologies.
- **Time management**: Meeting deadlines and handling multiple tasks.

## My Personal Commitment

This blog is part of my commitment to improving my soft skills. Writing regularly helps me organize my thoughts and express ideas more clearly. It's constant training that complements my efforts to improve verbal communication.

## Final Reflection

If you're like me, a technical professional primarily focused on improving your hard skills, I invite you to reconsider the value of soft skills. They aren't optional "extras," but essential components of your professional development.

Remember: the most elegant code loses value if you can't explain why and how it works. The most brilliant technical solutions fail if you don't truly understand the user's needs.

What about you? Have you neglected your soft skills by focusing too much on technical aspects? I invite you to share your experience and join this journey of integral growth.
