In the technology world, it's easy to get trapped behind a screen, solving problems, writing code, and creating digital solutions. However, there's a fundamental aspect that we sometimes overlook: human connection. Today I want to talk about a topic that I consider essential for any professional in the tech field: networking and the importance of stepping out of our digital bubble to grow both professionally and personally.

## We are social beings (even programmers)

It's easy to fall into the stereotype of the solitary developer, the one who prefers to interact with machines rather than humans. And while I personally enjoy my hours of concentration in front of code, I've discovered that there's a whole world of opportunities when we dare to go out and connect with other professionals.

As a species, humans are inherently social. Technology, despite everything it has allowed us to do remotely, doesn't replace the richness of interactions that occur when we're face to face with other people.

## Beyond the screen: the experience of in-person events

I've attended several meetups and tech events, and each one has left me with something valuable. I particularly remember a hackathon I went to: it was a completely different experience where I could immerse myself in the world of artificial intelligence. In fact, it was the first time I interacted with ChatGPT's GPTs when they had just been released - a technology that at that time was incredibly new and innovative.

While virtual events have their place (especially after the pandemic), there's something special about in-person meetings that simply can't be replicated through a screen:

- Non-verbal communication that says as much as words
- Spontaneous conversations during coffee breaks
- That relaxed atmosphere of having a beer while discussing technical ideas
- The ease of rotating and meeting different people in a short time
- Direct exchange of contacts and the feeling of real connection

## Networking: a long-term investment

It's important to understand that professional networking isn't a magic formula that produces instant results. It's more like a long-term investment in your career and personal growth. Every connection you make, every interesting conversation you have, every card you exchange is a seed you plant.

Over time, these connections can turn into job opportunities, project collaborations, mentorships, or simply valuable friendships with people who share your professional interests.

## Soft skills: the professional differentiator

One thing I've learned is that soft skills are equally or even more important than technical skills when it comes to professional advancement. Knowing how to program in five different languages is great, but if you can't effectively communicate your ideas or work in a team, your potential will be limited.

Networking events are the perfect gym to exercise these skills:

- Improving your verbal and non-verbal communication
- Practicing active listening
- Developing professional empathy
- Learning to introduce yourself and "sell" yourself effectively
- Strengthening your strategic networking capacity

## Practical tips to make the most of it

Based on my experiences, here are some tips to help you make the most of these events:

### Before the event

- Research who the speakers and notable attendees will be
- Prepare your "elevator pitch" - a brief and effective presentation about who you are
- Define clear objectives: what do you want to learn? who would you like to connect with?
- Bring business cards or make sure your LinkedIn profile is updated

### During the event

- Arrive early, it's usually easier to start conversations when there are fewer people
- Ask genuine questions and listen attentively
- Don't limit yourself to talking only with people you already know
- Actively participate in activities and discussions
- Take notes about the people you meet and the topics discussed

### After the event

- Connect on LinkedIn or other networks with the people you met
- Send a personalized message mentioning something specific from your conversation
- Share relevant resources or information you promised
- Keep in touch periodically, not just when you need something

## Community: a fundamental pillar

Beyond individual benefits, networking contributes to creating and strengthening professional communities. These communities are fundamental to the advancement of technology and our collective growth.

Belonging to a community provides you with:

- A safe space to ask questions and share knowledge
- Exposure to different perspectives and approaches
- A sense of belonging in a field that can feel overwhelming
- Opportunities to contribute and leave your mark

## Stepping out of the comfort zone

Every time I attend an event, I am consciously stepping out of my comfort zone. It's not always easy to approach strangers or participate in a technical discussion in front of other professionals. But it's precisely in these moments of discomfort where real growth happens.

Exposing yourself to new ideas, facing the fear of the unknown, and testing your social skills are exercises that strengthen your professional and personal resilience.

## Conclusion: beyond the code

Technology may be our work and our passion, but let's not forget that behind every line of code, every application, and every innovation, there are people. Connecting with these people not only enriches our professional career but also our human experience.

I encourage you to look for events in your city, join tech communities, and take that step outside your comfort zone. Networking isn't just a professional tool - it's a way to keep our curiosity alive, revitalize our passion for technology, and remember that, even in this digital world, we are fundamentally social beings.
