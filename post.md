ðŸš€ **Exciting News!** ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that my personal portfolio website has undergone a major upgrade and is now live in production! ðŸŽ‰

Built using #Astro, #Tailwind, and #TypeScript.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of whatâ€™s new:

- âœ… **Portfolio Collection with GitHub API**: Showcase of my projects integrated with GitHub.
- âœ… **Open Source Projects Section**: Highlighting my contributions to the open-source community.
- âœ… **Contact Form** using web3forms.
- âœ… **GitHub Actions** for Automated Tasks, tests, and reports.
- âœ… **Navbar with Burger Button**: Intuitive navigation that sticks to the top when scrolling.
- âœ… **Mobile-First Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all devices.

Iâ€™m incredibly proud of how it turned out and would love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!
